# Draft

- This repo is just for test and share in my 2025 Spring research.
- It is uncompleted, so it's unsafe for use.
- We are still working to improve it

## About

- Codes 99.99% stem from repo `libfacedetection.train`
- I just modify a little bit to make it compact for qrcode detection and support multi-class training.
- Thanks for all previous work by all geniuses!
